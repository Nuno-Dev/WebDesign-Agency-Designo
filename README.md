# WebDesign-Agency-Designo
Responsive 7 page WebDesign company website

Hi! This is a fully functional responsive website for a fictional WebDesign company called 'Designo' and has 7 different landing pages.

In this project I used Leaflet.js, SASS, e-mail and form validation aswell as Flexbox and a lot of exciting stuff. Hope you enjoy it!
